      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This recipe has been in the family for generations. Now I want to share what is the best memory of my childhood, when I visited my grandparents in Kelvington, Saskatchewan: waking up to freshly made waffles with Canadian maple syrup and crisp bacon. </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>2 cups sifted flour </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
          <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
          <li>2 cups buttermilk </li>
          <li>1 cup melted butter </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray or brush with oil.</li>
          <li>our, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
          <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir flour mixture into eggs, one third at a time, alternating with buttermilk, until just combined; stir in butter.</li>
          <li>Pour batter into preheated waffle iron; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
