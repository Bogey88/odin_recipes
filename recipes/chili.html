        <h1>Award Winning Chili</h1>
        <img src="../images/Chili.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This delicious chili took 2nd place at our local chili cook-off! Bet you can't eat just one bowl. If it is too thick, add water 1/4 cup at a time until you reach desired consistency. Even better tasting the second day!</p>
